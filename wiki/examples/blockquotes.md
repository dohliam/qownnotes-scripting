# Blockquotes examples

Below is a blockquote:

> This is quoted text

It is not very visually distinct from the rest of the text, other than that it is indented slightly.

## Linebreaks in blockquotes

These seem to be ignored, although this may be an issue with the Markdown spec more generally rather than QOwnNotes:

> This is an example of a blockquote
> That has text on separate lines
> The linebreaks are not respected
> 
> But they are if a blank is left between.
