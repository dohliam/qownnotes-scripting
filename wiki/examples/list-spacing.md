# List spacing

- if the last item in a list is indentented,
  - the top margin is spaced quite differently from all other items in the list,
  - whether indented or not
- for example, see the spacing of the items in this list
- each item has the same spacing,
  - except for the last one (which seems cut off from the rest as a result)
