# Utilities

Various command-line utilities for working with linked notes. Currently includes the following Ruby scripts:

* [[backlinks_cli]] - a version of the QOwnNotes [[scripts/backlinks]] script for use on the command-line
* [[note_stats]] - print a range of information and statistics about any collection of notes
* [[random_note]] - view a random note from the collection
* [[titles_in_folder]] - print a formatted list of all notes in a given folder

These can be used with any collection of linked notes and do not need to be used in connection with QOwnNotes. However, many of the above scripts replicate functionality of the QOwnNotes [[scripts]] included in this project, so they may be of interest to those looking to automate some aspect of processing their notes.
