# Default subfolder note

This script creates a menu item and a button to jump to the default or main note for the current subfolder.

Note: for the purposes of this script, the "default note" for a given subfolder is the note named identically to the subfolder itself. For example, the default note for the subfolder `examples` would be `examples/examples.md`

It is often helpful to have a default note that acts as an index linking all of the other notes in a subfolder, and this script helps to navigate to that note from any other note in the folder.
