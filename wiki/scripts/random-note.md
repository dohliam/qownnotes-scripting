# Random note

This script creates a menu item and a button to jump to a random note from the collection.

This can be helpful for reviewing notes you have not seen in a while, and is similar to the idea behind [zettelwarmer](https://github.com/whateverforever/zettelwarmer), for example. It might be interesting to incorporate checking the last modified date of notes to preferentially show older notes first.
